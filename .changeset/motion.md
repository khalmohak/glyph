Motion is on by default, and the theme controls it.

- New theme keys: `motion.level` (`none`, `subtle` or `expressive`) and `motion.spring` (`{ stiffness, damping, mass? }`). The spring is compiled to a CSS `linear()` curve, so CSS and JavaScript animations move the same way: `--glyph-ease-spring` and `--glyph-duration-spring`, the `ease-spring` utility, and `springEasing()` in `@glyphui/tokens`. Brutalist snaps with no bounce; Playful is expressive.
- `GlyphProvider` takes `motion` to override the level app-wide (e.g. `motion="none"` in tests). Visitors who prefer reduced motion never get animation. The level is mirrored to `<html data-motion>`, with `motion-none:` and `motion-expressive:` variants.
- Menus, popovers, selects, tooltips and hover cards spring out of their trigger and animate out before unmounting. Dialogs, alert dialogs and the command menu rise in and settle out. Overlays fade in and out.
- Sliding active indicators in Tabs, SegmentedControl, Sidebar and Pagination. Files in FileUpload and chips in TagInput animate in and out. The Switch thumb uses the theme spring, the Checkbox tick draws on when checked, and buttons press down.
- New primitives: `Reveal`, `Stagger`/`StaggerItem`, `AnimatedNumber`, `PageTransition`, `Presence`, `ActiveIndicator`, `m` (from `motion`) and `useMotionSettings`. Content never depends on JavaScript to become visible.
- Every block animates in on scroll; Stats count up and Pricing prices spring between monthly and yearly. Pass `animate={false}` to turn a block's entrance off.
